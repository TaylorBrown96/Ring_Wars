264,Spider,Arachnid,,50,2,"Bite, Web Attacks","Spider legs, Spider's eye","Like any abandoned area, there are always spiders making their home in the corner. However, these Arachnids have overstayed their welcome and now are bigger than the average spider."
230,Gold Goblin,Goblin,,68,15,Broken Sword,"Gold Pouch, bombs","Wherever there are corpses, there are gold goblins lurking about. They are usually the first to a corpse before any other monster or animal can feast upon it. They do not care for the armor, clothes, or the weapon the individual wielded, all they desire is the glittery gold that jingled in their pouches."
231,Infantry Goblin,Goblin,,75,20,"Broken Sword, Shield of the Round Table",Elixir,"In the goblin army hierarchy, they are the lowest level in the army. Seen as cannon fodder in battle, they are usually placed at the front of the line, so they may weaken the enemy’s frontline, with the high probability of death looming over them. Sometimes for fun, Infantry Goblins are purposefully given broken weaponry, as the army believed it would make them “fight harder to survive.”"
232,High Knight Goblin,Goblin,,100,35,"Lance of the Round Table, Shield of the Round Table","Elixir, Stone Skin, Gold Pouch",These goblins have earned their stripes. They’ve seen death in the face with their broken swords and have been deemed worthy to fight alongside the High Orc.
233,High Orc,Orc,,130,50,Hammer of the High Orc,"Elixir, King's Crown","If there are goblins lurking in an area, there’s always a High Orc close by. Seen as a figure of authority, the mere presence of a High Orc is enough to exponentially raise the morale of any goblin around them. With their hammer in hand, these Orcs are ready for anything that hits them and more than ready to hit back."

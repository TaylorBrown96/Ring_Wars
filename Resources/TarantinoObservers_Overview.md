# TarantinoObservers
Tarantino Observers is a text-based action RPG that allows the player to play as a freelance observer of the Tarantino family, who explores certain biomes to research mythical monsters such as witches, Wendigo, etc. The more monsters they find, the more information that the player can view later on. The main twist of this game is that some monsters that the player runs into, the player has the choice of either peacefully negotiating with the monster or attacking and killing them if communications do not go well. As the player befriends these monsters, they will join the playerâ€™s party, being able to utilize their special ability. The player will start in a hub menu, in which they can choose from three areas to observe: Desert, Forest, and the mountains. Each biome brings its own sets of mythical monsters for the player to interact with, some being harder to befriend than others.
